                        The argument blaming NGOs operating SAR in the Mediterranean for enabling the arrival of illegalised migrants on European shores had been until recently confined to the conspirationist discourse of small groups, often with ties to the far-right. On 15 November 2016 for example, GEFIRA, a Dutch-based think-tank, published an article with the self-explanatory title: &ldquo;Caught in the act: NGOs deal in migrant smuggling&rdquo; in which it accused NGOs of being &ldquo;part of the human smuggling network&rdquo;.
                            {% include footnote-block.html content='GEFIRA, &ldquo;Caught in the act: NGOs deal in migrant smuggling&rdquo;, 9 Novemebr 2016, <a href="https://gefira.org/en/2016/11/15/caught-in-the-act-ngos-deal-in-migrant-smuggling/">https://gefira.org/en/2016/11/15/caught-in-the-act-ngos-deal-in-migrant-smuggling/</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).

                        On 5 December 2016 the same organisation published another article titled: &ldquo;NGOs are smuggling immigrants into Europe on an industrial scale&rdquo;, arguing that NGO SAR operations amounted to an &ldquo;illegal human traffic operation&rdquo;.

A video showing a similar AIS-based visualisation and containing a comparable attack against SAR NGOs later became viral in the Italian media.

                        The article, which as the previous one was quickly picked up in several xenophobic news outlets, was accompanied by the release of a video monitoring the activities of SAR NGOs through AIS vessel tracking data.

                    The piece was based on &ldquo;confidential reports&rdquo; by Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, which according to the journalists accused the NGOs of &ldquo;colluding&rdquo; with smugglers (see Annex).

                    The article mentioned a particular incident that the agency considered to be &ldquo;the first reported case where the criminal networks directly approached an EU vessel and smuggled the migrants directly into Europe using the NGO vessel&rdquo;, a claim we will assess within this report. It further reported the agency deploring that &ldquo;the number of rescues triggered by a distress signal fell from roughly two-thirds of all incidents this summer to barely one in 10 in October (&hellip;). This drop-off coincided with a jump in the number of rescues carried out by NGOs in the central Mediterranean.&rdquo; Despite a partial retraction that forced the <em>Financial Times</em> to admit that it had &ldquo;overstated&rdquo; its accusations,

                    Frontex would consolidate its critique of SAR NGOs in subsequent publications in early February 2017.

                    </p>


                    <p>
                    On 15 February 2017, Frontex published its annual Risk Analysis Report, in which it made publicly accessible several of the claims that had been echoed by the <em>Financial Times</em>.
                        {% include footnote-block.html content='Frontex, <em>2017 Annual Risk Analysis</em>, 15 February 2017, <a href="http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/Annual_Risk_Analysis_2017.pdf">http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/Annual_Risk_Analysis_2017.pdf</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017). Let us recall that according to its mission of coordinating European border management, the first task that the agency mentions in its own summary is that of &ldquo;monitoring migratory flows and carrying out risk analysis regarding all aspects of integrated border management.&rdquo; In turn, Frontex describes its Risk Analysis reports as produced in the &ldquo;pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis&rdquo;, through the processing of &ldquo;information from diverse sources&rdquo;, which is further &ldquo;systematised&rdquo; into an analytical product so that Frontex may &ldquo;form a reliable basis for its operational activities.&rdquo; Ibid., p. 2.' %} 
                    It is useful to detail the way the agency&rsquo;s argument is formulated. With regards to the central Mediterranean, Frontex notes in its annual report that &ldquo;important changes were observed on this migratory route in 2016&rdquo;. However, of the many evolutions that the agency might have mentioned based on the reports available to it and that we will discuss in more detail further on, Frontex focuses on one &ndash; the role of NGOs in SAR activities. It first observes the decrease in satellite phone calls to the Italian Coast Guard Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in Rome to trigger rescue operations, which makes detecting and rescuing migrants more difficult and may result in vessels not being rescued. It then implicitly draws a &ldquo;parallel&rdquo; between this decrease and the increasing presence of SAR NGOs,
                        {% include footnote-block.html content='&ldquo;During 2015, and the first months of 2016, smuggling groups instructed migrants to make satellite phone calls to the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Rome to initiate targeted rescues on the high seas. SAR operations were mainly undertaken by Italian law-enforcement, EUNAVFOR Med or Frontex vessels with NGO vessels involved in less than 5% of the incidents. As shown in Figure 5, more than half of all rescue operations were initiated in this manner. From June until October 2016, however, the pattern was reversed. Satellite phone calls to MRCC Rome decreased sharply to 10% and NGO rescue operations rose significantly to more than 40% of all incidents.&rdquo; Frontex, <em>2017 Annual Risk Analysis</em>, 15 February 2017, p. 32, <a href="http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/Annual_Risk_Analysis_2017.pdf">http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/Annual_Risk_Analysis_2017.pdf</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %}

                    <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Frontex&rsquo;s report then continues to draw a second &ldquo;parallel&rdquo;: &ldquo;NGO presence and activities close to, and occasionally within, the 12-mile Libyan territorial waters nearly doubled compared with the previous year, totalling 15 NGO assets (14 maritime and 1 aerial). In parallel, the overall number of incidents increased dramatically&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>


                    <p>Frontex then generalises its critique of SAR to all actors operating close to the Libyan coast, without however discussing in detail their respective operations and impact. &ldquo;Libyan-based smugglers (&hellip;) heavily relied on the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), and associated SAR as well as humanitarian assistance efforts, turning it into a distinct tactical advantage. (&hellip;) Dangerous crossings on unseaworthy and overloaded vessels were organised with the main purpose of being detected by EUNAVFOR Med/Frontex and NGO vessels&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>We should underline how similar the argument formulated by Frontex here is to that it repeated, time and again, against Mare Nostrum in 2014 and that contributed to delegitimizing and ultimately terminating the operation, with the dramatic consequences documented in our <em>Death by Rescue</em> report.
                        {% include footnote-block.html content='&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of saying that it has been a pull factor but obviously the smugglers have abused of the proximity of the operation to the Libyan coast to, on the one hand to put more people on the sea, with the assumption that they will be rescued very soon, and this also made it cheaper for them, as I said, because they put and they are putting less fuel, less food, less water on the vessel, which at the same time also increases the risk for the migrants.&rdquo; Frontex&rsquo;s executive director, Gil Arias, answer to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) of the European Parliament on 4 September 2014.

                    <p>We can see here at work in an exemplary way Frontex&rsquo;s analytical and narrative strategy. First, it focuses on a single actor, SAR NGOs, isolating them from the web of interactions with other actors which together shape the dynamics of migration across the sea, and establishes parallels between their activities and trends relating to migration and smuggling. Second, it generalises its criticism of the &ldquo;unintended consequences&rdquo; of SAR to &ldquo;all parties involved in SAR operations&rdquo;. However, because of its previous singling out of SAR NGOs, and because NGOs have become the primary SAR actor in the central Mediterranean, they emerge as the main target of the criticism.</p>

                    <p>Based on these spurious correlations, Frontex has constructed a narrative which can be summarised in three main claims regarding SAR at sea, of which SAR NGOs are the main target:</p>

                        The broad contours of this narrative were put forward again and again by Frontex Director Fabrice Leggeri in different forums, such as in his interview with the German Newspaper <em>Die Welt</em> on 27 February.

                        Considering the credibility the Agency enjoys thanks to its institutional role and its advisory function to EU Member States, its attacks and allusions have surreptitiously created a climate of mistrust that has raised heinous doubts about the NGOs&rsquo; activities, generated hostility, and made further attacks possible.

Echoing the conspirationist positions expressed in the GEFIRA article and video, Zuccaro later justified his decision using the &ldquo;objective fact&rdquo; that NGOs are constituting a &ldquo;safe corridor&rdquo; that grants migrants an &ldquo;anomalous access&rdquo; to Italian territory,

                        As we will discuss discuss later these allegations are at best dubious, either because they have not been confirmed by any factual element, or simply because they involve practices that are normal in the context of SAR activities at sea (such as SAR vessels turning on their floodlights at night to establish a visual contact with migrants&rsquo; boats). However, on the basis of these claims, he has contributed to spreading serious doubts on the behaviour of nongovernmental actors conducting SAR operations at sea, and threatened that &ldquo;as soon as the occasion would present itself&rdquo;

                        The opening of Zuccaro&rsquo;s inquiry was followed by at least three other Italian Prosecutors Offices - Palermo, Cagliari and Trapani. While they are ongoing, these inquiries into the actions of civilian actors involved in the rescue of migrants at sea bring us back to a dark phase prior to Mare Nostrum when assistance to migrants in distress at sea by non-state actors was heavily criminalised. While all the most well-known legal cases of this period &ndash; such as the one involving the humanitarian ship Cap Anamur in 2004 and the one targeting 7 Tunisian fishermen in 2007 &ndash; ended with acquittals, they had the extremely dangerous effects of making non-state actors reluctant to rescue people in distress at sea, thus leading to repeated cases of non-assistance.

                        A second crucial forum for the debate around SAR NGOs&rsquo; activities in Italy have been the inquiries by two different parliamentary commissions. Both the so-called Schengen commission of the Chamber of Deputies and the Defence commission of the Senate have launched in late March and early April 2017 a series of public hearings with the aim of inquiring into these allegations and understanding the unfolding situation in the central Mediterranean. While the hearings have included representatives of all actors operating in the Central Mediterranean, and thus offered the opportunity for SAR NGOs to defend themselves against accusations, they also operated as an echo chamber for the accusations of the prosecutors investigating SAR NGOs and other state agencies. The findings of the Defence Commission of the Senate were published on 16 May 2017. While the Commission concluded that no evidence of collusion with smugglers had emerged,

                        it also lamented the opening of a &ldquo;privately-run humanitarian channel&rdquo;. To reassert state control over these matters, it called for SAR NGOs to be put under greater scrutiny, come under the full command of the Italian Maritime Rescue and Coordination Center (MRCC), and for police to travel aboard NGO vessels or be able to board them at every rescue.

                    <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
                        With the conjoined accusations by Frontex and the Italian Prosecutors and the echo these have received in the parliamentary hearings, the toxic narrative against SAR NGOs spread like a trail of powder across leading national newspaper and other mainstream media, but has also been picked up by key political and institutional figures not only in Italy, but also in Belgium and Austria.

                        While formulated each time in slightly different terms, the broad contours of this attack have been remarkably similar and have relied on a quite simple rhetorical strategy of de-contextualisation and omission.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First of all, statements criticising SAR NGOs have repeatedly shrouded their presence in the Mediterranean in a veil of mystery. The &ldquo;sudden proliferation&rdquo; of SAR NGOs described by Zuccaro,
                            {% include footnote-block.html content='Comitato parlamentare di controllo sull&#8217;attuazione dell&#8217;Accordo di Schengen, di vigilanza sull&#8217;attività di Europol, di controllo e vigilanza in materia di immigrazione, &ldquo;Audizione del procuratore della Repubblica presso il tribunale di Catania, dottor Carmelo Zuccaro&rdquo;, 22 March 2017, p. 10, <a href="http://www.camera.it/leg17/1079?idLegislatura=17&amp;tipologia=indag&amp;sottotipologia=c30_confini&amp;anno=2017&amp;mese=03&amp;giorno=22&amp;idCommissione=30&amp;numero=0041&amp;file=indice_stenografico">http://www.camera.it/leg17/1079?idLegislatura=17&amp;tipologia=indag&amp;sottotipologia=c30_confini&amp;anno=2017&amp;mese=03&amp;giorno=22&amp;idCommissione=30&amp;numero=0041&amp;file=indice_stenografico</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %}
                        the &ldquo;NGO madness&rdquo; evoked by the Austrian Foreign Ministry during official talks with Frontex,
                            {% include footnote-block.html content='&ldquo;&lsquo;NGO-Wahnsinn&rsquo;: Kurz kritisiert Retter im Mittelmeer&rdquo;, <em>ORF.at</em>, 24 March 2017, <a href="http://orf.at/stories/2384683/">http://orf.at/stories/2384683/</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %} 
                        and the &ldquo;paradox&rdquo; that their becoming the largest SAR operator in 2016 would constitute according to Frontex director Leggeri
                            {% include footnote-block.html content='Senato della Repubblica, 4&ordf; Commissione permanente (Difesa), &ldquo;Resoconto sommario n. 220 del 12/04/2017&rdquo;, 12 April 2017, <a href="https://www.senato.it/japp/bgt/showdoc/frame.jsp?tipodoc=SommComm&amp;leg=17&amp;id=1013350">https://www.senato.it/japp/bgt/showdoc/frame.jsp?tipodoc=SommComm&amp;leg=17&amp;id=1013350</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %}
                        are all examples of this. However, as we will discuss in more detail in the next section, the reasons that spurred a rising number of NGOs to dedicate themselves to SAR activities over the last two years are in no way hidden or dubious. The launch of their operations was a direct response to the EU and its member states&rsquo; decision to cut back state-led SAR in late 2014 and to the tragic consequences &ndash; extensively documented in our last report &ndash; of this decision that materialised in the first months 2015. It is the absence of those very institutions that now criticize NGOs, such as Frontex, in the area close to the Libyan coast, that has led the former to start their SAR operations.
                    </p>

                    <p>Secondly, de-contextualisation and strategic omission in statements criticising SAR NGOs allow for the recombination of otherwise truthful pieces of information into a spurious argument. It is for example undeniable that NGOs have become the largest SAR operator in the central Mediterranean, conducting 28% of all rescues in 2016, all the while we have witnessed worsening conditions of crossing leading to record numbers of deaths at sea. However, as we will demonstrate in this report, the temporal coincidence of these phenomena in no way proves that they were causally related &ndash; and on the contrary we will demonstrate that SAR NGOs <em>responded</em> to the increasingly dangerous conditions of crossing caused by other actors and played instead a crucial life-saving role.</p>

                    <p>Despite corrections and partial retractions, the toxic narrative that is produced through such omissions and recombinations has a number of extremely worrying effects which are still unfolding and to which we will return in more details in the conclusive section to our report.</p>
