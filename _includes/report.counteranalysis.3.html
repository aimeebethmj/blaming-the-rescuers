          By the beginning of 2016, the effects of the EUNAVFOR MED operation and the dynamics within Libya had combined to make the conditions of crossing increasingly dangerous. More people were crossing, in more boats that were less sea-worthy, in more dangerous conditions, and were in distress closer to the Libyan coast. SAR NGOs responded to this by seeking to rescue migrants closer to the Libyan coastline and helped make the crossing safer. However, in the process, they might have contributed to consolidate some of the shifts in smugglers&rsquo; tactics.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          From the above, we can see that the cumulative effects of the EUNAVFOR MED operation and of the dynamics within Libya, led to marked shifts in the strategies of smugglers towards worse conditions of crossing. More people crossed in 2016, and among them were more migrants of nationalities who resorted to the more dangerous &ldquo;low cost&rdquo; smuggling networks. More rubber boats were used, which are less resistant to adverse meteorological conditions, but also carry less people than wooden vessels, meaning that more vessels were sent out over the year &ndash; the number of SAR events leaped from 906 in 2015 to 1,424 in 2016.
              {% include footnote-block.html content='Italian Coast Guard, <em>Search And Rescue Activity and Migratory flows in the Central Mediterranean sea, </em>2016 yearly report, March 2017<em>, </em>p.2, <a href="http://www.guardiacostiera.gov.it/en/Documents/search-and-rescue-activity/search-and-rescue-activity-and-migratory-flows-in-central-mediterranean-sea.pdf">http://www.guardiacostiera.gov.it/en/Documents/search-and-rescue-activity/search-and-rescue-activity-and-migratory-flows-in-central-mediterranean-sea.pdf</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %}
          Smugglers also increasingly sent out many boats at once. As the Italian Coast Guard data shows, instances of more than 20 simultaneous cases of SAR occurred regularly over the summer months of 2016, with a staggering peak of 53 SAR events in one day reached on 29 August.
              {% include footnote-block.html content='Italian Coast Guard, <em>Search And Rescue Activity and Migratory flows in the Central Mediterranean sea, </em>2016 yearly report, March 2017<em>, </em>p.5, <a href="http://www.guardiacostiera.gov.it/en/Documents/search-and-rescue-activity/search-and-rescue-activity-and-migratory-flows-in-central-mediterranean-sea.pdf">http://www.guardiacostiera.gov.it/en/Documents/search-and-rescue-activity/search-and-rescue-activity-and-migratory-flows-in-central-mediterranean-sea.pdf</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %}
          Smugglers offered less provisions, launched migrants in worse weather conditions, and packed ever more migrants on boats of decreasing quality &ndash; with an average of 122 people aboard rubber boats recorded in 2016 compared with 103 in 2015.
              {% include footnote-block.html content='Italian Coast Guard, <em>Search And Rescue Activity and Migratory flows in the Central Mediterranean sea, </em>2016 yearly report, March 2017<em>, </em>p.14, <a href="http://www.guardiacostiera.gov.it/en/Documents/search-and-rescue-activity/search-and-rescue-activity-and-migratory-flows-in-central-mediterranean-sea.pdf">http://www.guardiacostiera.gov.it/en/Documents/search-and-rescue-activity/search-and-rescue-activity-and-migratory-flows-in-central-mediterranean-sea.pdf</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %}
          Cases with as many as 200 people aboard rubber boats were recorded. Such extreme overloading increased the risk of capsizing, which was further heightened by the fact that &ldquo;the wooden planks used to reinforce the floor of the rubber dinghies are so roughly cut that, on several overcrowded boats, they broke under the migrants&rsquo; weight&rdquo;, as Frontex notes in its 2016 AFIC report.
              {% include footnote-block.html content='Frontex, Africa-Frontex Intelligence Community Joint Report 2016, April 2017, p. 22. <a href="http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/AFIC/AFIC_2016.pdf">http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/AFIC/AFIC_2016.pdf</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %} 
          While death by suffocation and asphyxia were reported in previous years in instances when migrants were trapped in the hold of wooden vessels, over 2016 they were reported by NGOs even on rubber boats, with migrants being crushed by fellow passengers. While smugglers continued to seek to recover vessels and their engines&nbsp;for re-use

          &ndash; a task made increasingly difficult by the interdiction operated by EUNAVFOR MED &ndash; they also developed a new tactic noted in EUNAVFOR MED&rsquo;s 2016 report: &ldquo;the new modus operandi entails a skiff towing a rubber boat without an engine, which is then left adrift&rdquo;.

          This tactic proved lethal in several instances, such as the 26 May 2016 case involving the Watch The Med Alarm Phone.

          These worsening conditions of crossing find their expression in the increasing mortality rates recorded in April and May 2016, almost reaching the height of the mortality spike registered in April 2015.

        <p  style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
          As a result, situations of acute distress &ndash; imminent death &ndash; occurred closer and closer to the Libyan shores. In its 2015 report, EUNAVFOR MED had already recognized that &ldquo;<em>with the limited supply and the degree of overloading, the migrant vessels are [to be considered in distress according to international conventions] from the moment they launch</em>.&rdquo;

          In its 2016 report, it noted that &ldquo;<em>the majority of migrants still die inside or very close to Libyan territorial waters&rdquo;.</em>

          Similarly, in January 2016, Frontex noted an increase in incidents reported outside of the Triton operational zone, that is close to the Libyan coast.

        {% include image-block.html image='10_EC.jpg' caption='Map of SAR events between 2014-2016, showing that they grew closer to the Libyan coast.' %}

        <p  style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
          These shifts naturally had a dramatic impact on SAR activities. It should be noted that the peaks in mortality recorded in April and May 2016 occurred while SAR NGO vessels were still being redeployed after their winter break.
              {% include footnote-block.html content='2016 saw several SAR NGOs deploy new missions in the central Mediterranean. While in 2015 MOAS (Migrant Offshore Aid Station), MSF (M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res), Sea-Watch had been operating, in 2016 they were joined by SOS M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e, Sea-Eye, Jugend Rettet, Jugend Rettet, Proactiva Open Arms, Bootvluchteling. We should note that several of the new SAR missions deployed smaller vessels with a more limited capacity in terms of the number of people they are able to rescue.' %}
          There was still only one SAR NGO vessel present for most of April, that of SOS M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e, and only five were deployed in May. SAR NGOs accounted for a small fraction of SAR activities over these months &ndash; 4% in April and 12% in May. According to interviews conducted for this research, the assets of MSF and of Sea-Watch continued to be positioned beyond the 24nm limit when they were deployed at the end of April. MRCC Rome however increasingly directed them to intervene within the 24nm limit, where situations of imminent distress were being signalled. Over the summer, MSF&rsquo;s vessels maintained their default operational zone beyond the 24nm, while Sea-Watch and other SAR NGOs increasingly intervened proactively beyond that limit in order to best respond to cases of distress closer, and at times within, Libyan territorial waters. While inter-NGO competition characteristic of humanitarian contexts may have also played a part in this trend, moving closer to the Libyan coast corresponded to a humanitarian need.

        <p  style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
          Importantly, we can note that the mortality rate was brought down over the summer months, just as the NGO flotilla reached its peak deployment &ndash; with eleven SAR vessels &ndash; and the share of rescues operated by NGOs increased &ndash; with a peak of 35% in June. The mortality rate peaked once again in November and December when NGO SAR vessels progressively stopped their operations for the winter. Plotting the evolution of the mortality rate and that of the number of SAR NGO assets deployed at sea, we can observe a striking inverse correlation.
              {% include footnote-block.html content='The statistical analysis of the data conducted by Gian-Andrea Monsch, Researcher at Fors, University of Lausanne, Switzerland, shows that there is a strong negative correlation (- .345 Pearson&rsquo;s R) between the number of SAR NGO vessels and the migrant mortality rate. However, this correlation is not significant, with a 27% propensity that we cannot reproduce this correlation in other years. While the result is only reliable for the year 2016, the analysis of the data for 2015 has also shown a strong negative correlation ( -.532 Pearson&rsquo;s R), which is borderline significant (below the 10% benchmark).' %}
          The importance of an increasing number of SAR assets proactively deployed to make the crossing safer is logical: only a high number of assets close to the Libyan coast could respond to the multiplication of SAR cases that was being observed in this area. In November, SAR NGO presence remained important, but encountered several adverse conditions that mitigated the capacity to avert deaths at sea. First, record crossings in October and November were observed, while these months normally see decreasing crossings as meteorological conditions worsen &ndash; a phenomenon which Frontex attributes once again to the presence of &ldquo;maritime assets are patrolling close to the Libyan shore&rdquo; without providing any evidence of this causal connection.
              {% include footnote-block.html content='Frontex notes that &ldquo;the number of arrivals increased in October and November compared to the same months in 2015. Despite tough weather conditions during this period of the year, migrant arrivals continued unabated mainly from Libya. The smuggling networks are aware that the maritime assets are patrolling close to the Libyan shore, and for that reason they are encouraging the migrants to sail even when the sea is rough because they will be rescued soon after their departure.&rdquo; Frontex, JO EPN Triton, Biweekly Analytical Update, 24 Nov-4 Dec, 4 December 2016, p.2. See Annex. This is yet one more example of Frontex singling out the presence of vessels near the coast &ndash; which are mainly those of SAR NGOs - as the cause of migration dynamics that are without a doubt more complex. We should first note that there is no reason why the presence of SAR NGOs near the coast, which had been ongoing since several months, should suddenly lead to such a sharp increase in crossings. Second, this claim completely leaves out the dynamics within the smuggling business and the changing composition of migrants&rsquo; nationalities discussed above &ndash; more migrants from West and Central African nationalities were crossing over 2016, and these tend to continue to depart over winter months. Third, this leaves out entirely the volatile political conjuncture on Libyan territory at the time. Nancy Porsia notes for example that this was a period of intense clashes for the control of the port of Zawiya, as well as intense confrontations in Tripoli, both of which may have spurred more crossings. Mark Micallef further notes the coastal road linking Tripoli to Zawiya and the west coast that had been closed since October 2015 was re-opened for most of September, October and the first part of November. This eased the transport of migrants towards the coast and may have contributed to more crossings (email exchange with Mark Micallef, May 2017).' %} 
          High winds were repeatedly recorder in November and several lethal incidents occurred in bad weather over the month.
              {% include footnote-block.html content='See the data collected at Lampedusa airport for November 2016: <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/LICD/2016/11/27/MonthlyHistory.html?req_city=Lampedusa&amp;req_state=&amp;req_statename=Italy&amp;reqdb.zip=00000&amp;reqdb.magic=3&amp;reqdb.wmo=16490">https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/LICD/2016/11/27/MonthlyHistory.html?req_city=Lampedusa&amp;req_state=&amp;req_statename=Italy&amp;reqdb.zip=00000&amp;reqdb.magic=3&amp;reqdb.wmo=16490</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %}
          In addition, while the number of SAR NGO assets decreased to seven in November, this month saw the highest share of rescue performed by SAR NGOs &ndash; 47%. This indicates that other actors must have disengaged at the time as NGOs absorbed a greater share of rescues with fewer assets; we note in particular the decreasing share of rescues operated by EUNAVFOR MED and Frontex in November. With a greater burden to carry in more adverse conditions, the activities of SAR NGOs were not able to mitigate the increasing danger of crossing in November.

          The NGO flotilla thus RESPONDED to trends in smuggling practices that had been spurred by the anti-smuggling operation, as well as endogenous dynamics in Libya, and the increasing presence of NGO SAR vessels did in fact make the crossing less dangerous. While looking at overall data for the year of 2016 may give the paradoxical impression, repeatedly pointed out in attacks against SAR NGOs, that the increase in both the mortality rate and the share of SAR operations carried out by NGOs were simultaneous, a month by month analysis reveals the positive impact these operations had in reducing the danger of the crossings. At the same time, it is probable that their presence so close to the Libyan coast further contributed to consolidate smugglers&rsquo; new practices.
          </p>
        </div>


        <p>
          We can understand why smugglers would be seeking to rely on NGOs. As the EUNAVFOR MED&rsquo;s 2016 report mentions: &ldquo;It could be argued that by operating so close to the Libyan territorial waters the NGO presence has allowed the smugglers to recover boats to the shore more easily for re-use and shorten the average rescues from 75nm to 35 and now 20nm from the Libyan shore.&rdquo;

          In addition, echoing Frontex&rsquo;s analysis, the report notes the decrease in the provision of satellite phones by smugglers to migrants and attributes it to the identifiable presence of the NGO SAR vessels, noting that &ldquo;this is believed to be because smugglers seem to be aware where they can reliably find rescuing assets particularly from the NGO&rsquo;s who broadcast their position via the Automatic Identification System (AIS).&rdquo; The use of online vessel tracking platforms to identify the location of NGO SAR assets was confirmed to Nancy Porsia by smugglers in Libya.
              {% include footnote-block.html content=' See Nancy Porsia in annex.' %}
          The decreasing use of satellite phones, which normally allow migrants to alert the Italian Coast Guard, in turn made the deployment of SAR assets close to the Libyan coast an absolute humanitarian necessity since this became the condition to detect vessels that might otherwise have drifted or sunk unnoticed.
        </p>

        <p  style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
          While the practices of SAR NGOs may thus have inadvertently contributed to consolidating the shifts in smugglers&rsquo; practices, there has so far been no evidence of the criminal collaboration with smugglers alluded to by several actors, and as such, we cannot engage with these claims in details. As we mentioned in the &ldquo;toxic narrative&rdquo; section, Carmelo Zuccaro, public prosecutor in Catania, has claimed that &ldquo;telephone calls from Libya to certain NGOs, floodlights lighting up the way to the boats of these organisations, ships that suddenly cut their transponder (allowing for their localization) are proven facts&rdquo;.
              {% include footnote-block.html content='Fabio Albanese, &ldquo;Abbiamo le prove dei contatti tra scafisti e alcuni soccorritori&rdquo;, <em>La Stampa</em>, <a href="http://www.lastampa.it/2017/04/23/italia/cronache/abbiamo-le-prove-dei-contatti-tra-scafisti-e-alcuni-soccorritori-3fCnqLKWWRHBVUiygHv65K/pagina.html">http://www.lastampa.it/2017/04/23/italia/cronache/abbiamo-le-prove-dei-contatti-tra-scafisti-e-alcuni-soccorritori-3fCnqLKWWRHBVUiygHv65K/pagina.html</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %}
          Zuccaro&rsquo;s claims appear to simply seek to turn standard practices which SAR actors, state and civilian alike, have been undertaking openly for years, into a suspicious practice. While NGOs such as the WatchTheMed - Alarmphone and state agencies in charge of rescue alike routinely receive distress calls via satellite phone from migrants at sea following which SAR operation are triggered, direct contact between the smugglers and SAR NGOs at sea has been firmly denied by all SAR NGOs. For what concerns the (mis-)use of floodlights, SAR vessels ordinarily turn on their lights to be able to be seen by vessels in distress in the night. Finally, it is not uncommon that the poor quality of AIS vessel tracking coverage off the coast of Libya leads to interruptions in the transmission of positions. If these are the practices Zuccaro has &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of, they do not involve criminal activity. In fact the claims of criminal activity have been increasingly retracted by several prosecutors as they failed to find conclusive evidence.

        <p>
          Even Frontex&rsquo; interpretation of the already mentioned incident of December 2016, which the Agency claimed to be &ldquo;the first reported case where the criminal networks directly approached an EU vessel and smuggled the migrants directly into Europe using the NGO vessel&rdquo;, has subsequently been revealed to be spurious.
              {% include footnote-block.html content='Frontex, JO EPN Triton, Biweekly Analytical Update, 24 Nov-4 Dec, 4 December 2016, p.6. See Annex.' %}
          In this incident, Frontex reports that according to the Italian authorities, &ldquo;a small fibreglass boat in the area displaying a Libyan flag with persons pretending to be fishermen (&hellip;) approached one of the NGO vessels <em>Minden</em> and transferred two Libyan citizens from the small boat to the EU vessel claiming that they were migrants. The NGO vessel took them aboard and let the Libyan boat leave the area. After the debriefing activities, the migrants stated that the crew aboard the small Libyan boat were the people smugglers&rdquo;.
              {% include footnote-block.html content='Frontex, JO EPN Triton, Biweekly Analytical Update, 24 Nov-4 Dec, 4 December 2016, p.6. See Annex.' %}
          However, as investigative journalist Zack Campbell has demonstrated in his detailed reconstruction of the reported case, in all probability the reported incident involved &ldquo;engine fishers&rdquo; &ndash; often fishermen who as an additional lucrative activity recuperate engines from the boats from which migrants have been rescued. Regardless of their identity, what is most important is that they did not &ldquo;smuggle migrants directly into Europe using the NGO vessel&rdquo; but simply supported the SAR operation by pulling out of the water two people after their boat had capsized.

          From the scarce elements that were put forth and our analysis of them, as has been the case for the Italian Senate&rsquo;s Defence Commission, no evidence of collusion with smugglers emerges.

          From the analysis above, it appears clearly that NGO SAR vessels were not the <em>drivers</em> of shifts in smugglers&rsquo; practices, but rather sought to <em>respond</em> to them. Their deployment close to the Libyan coast was made necessary by the increasingly dangerous conditions of crossing, and may have in turn consolidated some of the smugglers&rsquo; new tactics &ndash; as indicated by the &ldquo;parallel&rdquo; developments of SAR NGO presence and the decreasing use of satellite phones. Over the period of the peak deployment of SAR NGOs however, the mortality rate was substantially reduced. Our analysis thus reveals that, contrary to the claim made by Frontex and others, SAR NGOs have made the crossing safer.
