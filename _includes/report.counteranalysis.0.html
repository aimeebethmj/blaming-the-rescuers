					While several aspects of the attacks alluded to above have proven baseless or have already been effectively refuted by others,
						{% include footnote-block.html content='NGOs have themselves responded to these accusations in parliamentary hearings (videos and transcripts can be found here: <a href="https://www.senato.it/static/bgt/listasommcomm/0/4/s/17/index.html">https://www.senato.it/static/bgt/listasommcomm/0/4/s/17/index.html</a> - April and May 2017 sessions), with online articles (particularly useful a FAQ on Search and Rescue in the Mediterranean by M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res: &ldquo;Le domande pi&ugrave; frequenti sulle nostre operazioni di ricerca e soccorso nel Mediterraneo&rdquo;, 27 March 2017, <a href="http://www.medicisenzafrontiere.it/notizie/news/le-domande-pi%C3%B9-frequenti-sulle-nostre-operazioni-di-ricerca-e-soccorso-nel-mediterraneo">http://www.medicisenzafrontiere.it/notizie/news/le-domande-pi%C3%B9-frequenti-sulle-nostre-operazioni-di-ricerca-e-soccorso-nel-mediterraneo</a>, last accessed 12 May 2017) and in numerous press conferences. Several articles have gathered the main rebuttal points against this toxic narrative. See in particular: Annalisa Camilli, &ldquo;Perch&eacute; le ong che salvano vite nel Mediterraneo sono sotto attacco&rdquo;, <em>Internazionale</em>, <a href="http://www.internazionale.it/notizie/annalisa-camilli/2017/04/22/ong-criminalizzazione-mediterraneo">http://www.internazionale.it/notizie/annalisa-camilli/2017/04/22/ong-criminalizzazione-mediterraneo</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017) and Francesco Floris e Lorenzo Bagnoli, &ldquo;Accuse alle Ong: cosa c&rsquo;&egrave; di falso o di sviante&rdquo;, <em>Open Migration</em>, 10 May 2017, http://openmigration.org/analisi/accuse-alle-ong-cosa-ce-di-falso-o-di-sviante/ (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %} 
					we will mainly focus on the underlying claims put forward by Frontex that the presence of the NGOs would be the cause of an increase in both the numbers and danger of crossings.
						{% include footnote-block.html content='While, as we have described in the previous section, this line of argument was initially put forward by Frontex, it was later appropriated also by Carmelo Zuccaro, the public prosecutor in Catania who has opened a fact-finding mission on SAR NGOs activities.

					Our focus is justified on the one hand, by the gravity of these accusations given the Agency&rsquo;s prominent institutional role; on the other, we consider the increase in the mortality rate a worrying development that demands a serious evaluation in and of itself, so as to assess which actors, practices and processes are responsible for it and how one may in turn make the crossing safe(r).
				</p>


				<p>
					In what follows we will not dispute the reality of several key trends highlighted by Frontex and other actors, such as: the increasing crossings of the central Mediterranean &ndash; which have risen from 153,842 in 2015 to 181,436 in 2016;
						{% include footnote-block.html content='UNHCR data, available on the web portal dedicated to the Mediterranean <a href="http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean">http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %} 
					the worsening conditions of crossing exemplified by the overloading of rubber boats that increased from an average of 103 people per boat in 2015 to 122 in 2016;
						{% include footnote-block.html content='Italian Coast Guard, <em>Search And Rescue Activity and Migratory flows in the Central Mediterranean sea, </em>2016 yearly report, March 2017<em>, </em><a href="http://www.guardiacostiera.gov.it/en/Documents/search-and-rescue-activity/search-and-rescue-activity-and-migratory-flows-in-central-mediterranean-sea.pdf">http://www.guardiacostiera.gov.it/en/Documents/search-and-rescue-activity/search-and-rescue-activity-and-migratory-flows-in-central-mediterranean-sea.pdf</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %} 
					and the rise both in the number of deaths &ndash; from 2,892 in 2015 to 4,581 in 2016 - and in the mortality rate &ndash; from 1.84 in 2015 to 2.5 in 2016.
						{% include footnote-block.html content='IOM data for deaths, available on the web portal dedicated to the Mediterranean <a href="http://missingmigrants.iom.int/mediterranean">http://missingmigrants.iom.int/mediterranean</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017). The mortality rate is our own calculation based on IOM data for deaths and UNHCR data for arrivals. For the methodology see the statistical annex to <em>Death by Rescue</em>. Charles Heller and Lorenzo Pezzani, &ldquo;Death by Rescue: The Lethal Effects of the EU&#8217;s Policies of Non-Assistance&rdquo;, 18 April 2016, deathbyrescue.org (last accessed 12 April 2016).' %}
					What we will challenge, however, is the way Frontex has claimed that (NGO) SAR activities are <em>causally</em> <em>connected</em> to these trends, all the while occluding much more important processes and actors &ndash; including the regional political and economic contexts in Africa, EU policies and operations at sea, the intervention of the Libyan Coast Guard and the organisation of smuggling in Libya. In what follows, we seek to reconnect causal chains that have been severed by Frontex&rsquo;s biased analysis in order to explain the trends outlined above.

                <p  style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
                	To understand both the rise in crossings and in fatalities in 2016, we must take up the analysis of the situation in the central Mediterranean where we left it upon the publication of our report <em>Death by Rescue</em> one year ago.
                		{% include footnote-block.html content='Charles Heller and Lorenzo Pezzani, &ldquo;Death by Rescue: The Lethal Effects of the EU&#8217;s Policies of Non-Assistance&rdquo;, 18 April 2016, deathbyrescue.org (last accessed 12 April 2016).' %} 
                	We noted then that following the April 2015 shipwrecks, there had been a (re-)expansion of activities at sea by both state and non-state actors. Several new humanitarian SAR NGOs missions were launched, deploying their vessels off the Libyan coast to rescue migrants in distress.
                		{% include footnote-block.html content='While only MOAS (Migrant Offshore Aid Station) had been in operation over 2014, in 2015 MSF (M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res) joined with two vessels and Sea-Watch with one. Four SAR NGO vessels were deployed in 2015.' %}
                	At the same time, we saw the partial expansion of Frontex&rsquo;s Triton operation and the launching of the anti-smuggling EUNAVFOR MED operation, which have since operated as a border-control and anti-smuggling operation respectively. For the operations Triton and EUNAVFOR MED, SAR activities have always been subordinate to their security-oriented mission.
                </p>

					Over most of 2015, complementarity prevailed over conflict between these two groups of actors and their distinct operational logics. A certain &ldquo;division of labour&rdquo; emerged, with rescues operated by NGOs allowing security-oriented actors to focus on their main tasks of surveillance, interceptions of smugglers and destruction of vessels. Both appeared to be able to fulfil their respective objectives. From a humanitarian perspective, by the end of 2015, the nongovernmental flotilla had been able to rescue more than 20,000 people, representing some 13% of all rescues. Even though 2,800 people died in the central Mediterranean between May and December 2015, the effort of all actors brought the mortality rate down to a level comparable to that recorded during Mare Nostrum. From a security perspective, the crossings had also slightly diminished. This allowed EUNAVFOR MED to boast in its first 6 monthly report that between January and the end of December 2015, &ldquo;for the first time in 3 years, we have seen a 9% reduction in the migrant flow using the central (Mediterranean) route&rdquo; in relation to the same period in 2014.
						{% include footnote-block.html content='European External Action Service (EEAS), <em>EUNAVFOR MED Op SOPHIA - Six Monthly Report 22 June - 31 December 2015</em>, 28 January 2016, p.3.

					&ldquo;This reduction,&rdquo; the report explained, &ldquo;is due to the improved security situation in Egypt, which is making it more difficult for migrants to cross into Libya coming from the Middle East especially Syrians, the eastern route being much safer and shorter route, and the deterrence effect provided in international waters by EUNAVFOR Med assets&rdquo;.
						{% include footnote-block.html content='European External Action Service (EEAS), <em>EUNAVFOR MED Op SOPHIA - Six Monthly Report 22 June - 31 December 2015</em>, 28 January 2016, p.5.

					EUNAVFOR MED expected this decrease to continue, noting that &ldquo;this is an encouraging decrease in the flow and should continue to be driven down through EUNAVFOR MED&rsquo;s continued efforts&rdquo;.

					In retrospect, we can see that the rise in crossings and deaths that unfolded over 2016 were the product of dynamics already at work in 2015 but that remained largely invisible. In what follows, we will reconstruct how these dynamics materialised over the second half of 2015 and 2016. First, we analyse the variegated migration dynamics according to different countries of origin, demonstrating that despite the overall decrease over 2015, arrivals from several nationalities were increasing, and the trends over 2016 only continued those already underway over 2015. Second, we analyse the (f)actors that influenced the shifts in smugglers&rsquo; tactics, focusing on the evolution of the EUNAVFOR MED operation and its effects, and on analysing dynamics that took place on Libyan territory &ndash; particularly the growing involvement of militias in smuggling activities and the increasing intervention of the Libyan Coast Guard. Finally, we will analyse the response of NGOs and how they affected smugglers&rsquo; tactics and the danger of crossing.
