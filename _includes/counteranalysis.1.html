          While Frontex and other actors blame NGOs for constituting a pull-factor and leading to more crossings of the central Mediterranean, in fact deeper regional economic and political dynamics were leading to increased migration to and from Libya prior to SAR NGOs&rsquo; deployment.

          EUNAVFOR MED&rsquo;s prognosis that the &ldquo;decrease&rdquo; observed over 2015 &ldquo;should continue to be driven down through EUNAVFOR MED&rsquo;s continued efforts&rdquo; was deeply flawed. What it missed was the different dynamics affecting migrants of different countries of origin. This was perceived much more clearly by Frontex, which, in its Annual Risk Analysis report released in early 2016, noted that:

                    “In 2015, there were 153 946 detections of illegal border-crossing on the Central Mediterranean route, representing a 10% decrease compared to 2014. The decrease is due to a fall in Syrians (about 40 000 in 2014, but fewer than 7 500 in 2015) after a shift towards the Eastern Mediterranean route. However, the number of East and West Africans steadily increased from below 80 000 in 2014 to more than 108 000 in 2015 (+42%).”

          In retrospect, we can see how the drop in overall numbers registered by EUNAVFOR MED over 2015 was simply due to the fact that Syrians had all but stopped crossing the central Mediterranean after the April 2015 shipwrecks and the temporary opening of the so-called Balkan route in Autumn 2015, reaching Europe along the much shorter and safer Aegean route. While 2015 registered an overall decrease of 16,000 arrivals along the central Mediterranean route compared to the previous year, the decrease in the number of Syrians using this route was around 32,500. It is therefore easy to see that crossings by migrants of other nationalities were actually already <em>increasing</em> over 2015.

          In this same report, Frontex further recognises that migrants from the Horn of Africa - Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan - are &ldquo;<em>driven</em> by regional security issues, slow economic development, and lack of long-term livelihood options for refugees in the region&rdquo;.

          While Eritreans had been a prominent nationality amongst arrivals in Italy for several years and increased sharply as of summer 2013, in 2015 they became the top nationality arriving to Italy, with 39,162 arrivals. In 2015, arrivals of Sudanese migrants showed one of the sharpest increases (+194%), in the context of the deteriorating situation in Darfur at the time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Concerning West African migrants, Frontex notes that &ldquo;motivation for migration may vary among individuals, but most are believed to be pushed by economic motivations&rdquo;.

          Nevertheless, for the second strongest increase over 2015 - Nigerians (+166%), Frontex notes in its December 2015 Biweekly report that<strong> &ldquo;</strong>the precarious situation in North-Eastern Nigeria, with continuous attacks perpetrated by insurgents and radical Islamist groups, mainly Boko Haram<strong><em>, </em></strong>have led to the internal displacement of over 2.1 million people in Northern Nigeria. Most of the displaced people are settled in host communities and camps, but in precarious conditions, with many of them deciding to try to reach a better place to live&rdquo;.

          Frontex thus perceived clearly the <em>increase</em> in arrivals over 2015 from different African countries and that these were driven by contexts of economic and political crisis across the continent. To understand the increasing arrivals over 2015 by several different East, Central and West African nationalities, one would need to offer a more detailed analysis of political and economic trends in each country that contributed to outwards migration, an analysis which lies beyond the scope of this research. It would also be necessary to analyse the distinct smuggling networks they resort to &ndash; an issue which we will return to, which may have either eased or added friction to migrants&rsquo; movements. For the purpose of our present analysis however, what is crucial is that <strong>the increasing migratory trends from several parts of Africa that were underway over 2015, and noted by Frontex, largely continued over 2016.</strong> While there were exceptions, in particular with a decrease in the arrivals of Eritrean nationals by nearly half,
            {% include footnote-block.html content='Eritrean arrivals decreased from 39,162 in 2015 to 20,176 in 2016 (with some of these leaving from Egypt instead of Libya). This was due to the arrest of several key figures in the smuggling networks they resorted to in Italy and elsewhere in Europe; to increasing pressure along their route, in and across Sudan in particular; and finally, to the brutal murder of fellow nationals by ISIS affiliated militias in Libya.

          the sharp increases in arrivals from several African nationalities remained steady over 2016 especially for migrants from Nigeria, Gambia, and Ivory Coast. The number of Nigerians arriving on Italian shores increased from 22,237 in 2015 to 37,551 in 2016, making Nigerians the top nationality.

                    “the Central Mediterranean saw the highest number of migrant arrivals ever recorded from sub-Sahara, West Africa and the Horn of Africa (181 459 migrants, increase of 18% compared with 2015). This trend, <em>which is consistent with previous year-on-year increases</em>, shows that the Central Mediterranean has become the main route for African migrants to the EU and it is very likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.”

          Frontex thus itself recognises that the rising crossings in 2016 was consistent with the increase amongst migrants of different Sub-Saharan nationalities, which had begun already over 2015 - that is, prior to NGO SAR assets becoming the biggest rescue actor in the central Mediterranean. The latter could thus not be the cause of the increase. It further recognises some of the regional &ldquo;drivers&rdquo; of migration related to economic and political crises affecting the region. The fact that NGOs were not the key driver of increased crossings from African migrants is further corroborated by the 46% increase in crossings over 2016 documented by Frontex in the Western Mediterranean, in absence of any NGO SAR assets whatsoever. &ldquo;As in the case of the Central Mediterranean route, Frontex notes, most migrants were from Africa, indicating a growing pressure of illegal immigration from this continent towards the EU.&rdquo;

          While these trends and the regional dynamics that were driving them were reported by Frontex both internally and externally, they were not mentioned in relation to arguments that focused on the role of SAR NGOs allegedly constituting a pull-factor. This occlusion contributed to the toxic narrative against SAR NGOs.
