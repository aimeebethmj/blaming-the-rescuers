            <p>The report was based on extensive fieldwork in Italy. The authors thank the numerous actors who accepted to share their knowledge with us. Our gratitude goes in the first instance to the migrants we interviewed. Without their trust, this report would not be possible. We further thank the SAR NGOs, in particular M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, Sea-Watch and the WatchTheMed Alarmphone, for their openness to our research, allowing for exchange in full transparency and privileged access to documents and data. We further thank state actors who granted us interviews and responded to our queries (the Italian Coast Guard and Customs Police, Frontex, military personnel).</p>

            <p>The production of this report has necessitated that we consult with experts who generously shared their knowledge with us and helped us sharpen our analysis. Our gratitude goes to:</p>

            <p>Legal expert: Itamar Mann</p>

            <p>Migration policy experts: Chris Jones, Marie Martin, Paolo Cuttitta</p>

            <p>Libya expert: Mark Micallef</p>

            <p>Statistics experts: Manuela Honegger-Heller, Gian-Andrea Monsch</p>

            <p>Oceanography expert: Richard Limeburner</p>

            <p>Over the years, we have benefited from the insights of numerous NGOs, and their contribution was fundamental to the understanding of the situation at the maritime frontiers of the EU. We thank in particular the WatchTheMed, Migreurop, Boats4People and EuroMed Rights networks, as well as Statewatch, Amnesty International, ARCI, Meltingpot and Borderline Sicily.</p>
