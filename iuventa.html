                    <p>The "toxic narrative" unleashed against them did not have any effect in the judicial domain until on 2 August, the ship Iuventa of the German NGO Jugend Rettet (‘Youth Rescue’) was seized by the Italian judiciary under suspicion of ‘assistance to illegal migration’ and collusion with smugglers during three different rescue operations.</p>

                    <p>These NGOs were forced to deploy their own rescue missions in a desperate attempt to fill the gap in search and rescue capabilities created by the EU and its member states’s decision to pull back from rescue at sea at the end of 2014.</p>
