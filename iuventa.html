                      It has been two years since more than 1,200 people perished at sea in the 12<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> of April 2015 shipwrecks &ndash; the largest to have been documented in recent Mediterranean history. These deaths, as we demonstrated in the <em>Death by Rescue</em> report published last year, were the result of the termination of the Italian Mare Nostrum (MN) operation, which had patrolled close to the Libyan coast to rescue migrants in distress.

                      The end of Mare Nostrum left a huge gap in Search and Rescue (SAR) capabilities that, partially filled by ill-equipped merchant vessels, led to a staggering increase in deaths at sea in early 2015. Despite these consequences and the recognition that ending Mare Nostrum was a &ldquo;serious mistake&rdquo;,

                      no proactive state-led SAR operation was launched as a response, and the SAR gap was progressively filled by SAR NGOs.

                      Today the SAR activities courageously undertaken by NGOs are under attack.

                      Despite their crucial life-saving role, SAR NGOs have in recent months become the object of a de-legitimisation and criminalisation campaign that has not only involved Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, high-level politicians, and the media, but has also led to the opening of several exploratory inquiries by prosecutors in Italy. While some of the most heinous aspects of these attacks have proven baseless or have already been effectively refuted,

Several articles have gathered the main rebuttal points against this toxic narrative. See in particular: Annalisa Camilli, &ldquo;Perch&eacute; le ong che salvano vite nel Mediterraneo sono sotto attacco&rdquo;, <em>Internazionale</em>, <a href="http://www.internazionale.it/notizie/annalisa-camilli/2017/04/22/ong-criminalizzazione-mediterraneo">http://www.internazionale.it/notizie/annalisa-camilli/2017/04/22/ong-criminalizzazione-mediterraneo</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017) and Francesco Floris e Lorenzo Bagnoli, &ldquo;Accuse alle Ong: cosa c&rsquo;&egrave; di falso o di sviante&rdquo;, <em>Open Migration</em>, 10 May 2017, <a href="http://openmigration.org/analisi/accuse-alle-ong-cosa-ce-di-falso-o-di-sviante/">http://openmigration.org/analisi/accuse-alle-ong-cosa-ce-di-falso-o-di-sviante/</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %} 
                      the core of our report focuses on a subtler and yet no less grave line of criticism that was initially formulated by Frontex and that revolves around the alleged effect of proactive SAR on the dynamics of migration across the sea. The main lines of this argument can be summarized as follows: SAR NGOs are (1) constituting a &ldquo;pull-factor&rdquo; leading to more migrants attempting the dangerous crossing; (2) &ldquo;<em>unintentionally helping criminals&rdquo;</em> by encouraging smugglers to use even poorer quality boats and more dangerous tactics; (3) in turn making the crossing more dangerous for migrants.

                      Our report analyses of the dynamics of migration across the sea between 2015 and 2016 to assess these claims. Our focus is justified on the one hand, by the gravity of these accusations given the Agency&rsquo;s prominent institutional role; on the other, we consider the increase in the danger of crossing a worrying development that demands a serious evaluation in and of itself. By untangling the threads of the multiple processes and actors that have shaped these dynamics we demonstrate the accusations formulated against SAR NGOs rest on biased analysis and spurious causality links.</p>

                    <p>The following report relies on new findings generated through extensive interviews with state officials, SAR NGOs and migrants, as well as newly accessed official reports, analysis by investigative journalists specialising in smuggling networks in Libya, statistical analysis and cartographic methods. It has been produced by <em>Forensic Oceanography</em> &ndash; a research team based within the Forensic Architecture agency at Goldsmiths (University of London) that specialises in the use of forensic techniques and cartography to reconstruct the conditions that lead to deaths at sea.</p>

                    <p>At the core of this report, lies the analysis of the dynamics of migration across the sea between 2015 and 2016. We rely on official documents, statistics, qualitative interviews, photographs and maps to assess how the conditions and the danger of crossings has evolved, and how the main actors operating at sea (including the state-led operations of the EU and its member states at sea, Libyan officials, smugglers, SAR NGOs and migrants) have affected them. While our report does generate substantial new data, it also relies on existing analysis by official bodies and other forms of expertise. This is important to demonstrate that the analysis we are offering would have been available but has been occluded in attacks against SAR NGOs.</p>

                    <p>After this introduction, in section 2, entitled &ldquo;Toxic Narrative&rdquo;, we offer a brief summary of the main claims put forward against SAR NGO missions by a variety of actors including media outlets with ties to the far-right, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard agency, Italian prosecutors and institutions, and high-level political leaders across Europe. Analysing these claims, we briefly reconstruct the spread over time and from one actor to another, as well as their overall logic. We show that this toxic narrative has created a climate of hostility towards NGOs that threatens the continuation of their operations.</p>

                    <p>In section 3, entitled &ldquo;Counter Analysis&rdquo;, we analyse the three main accusations against SAR NGOs our report focuses on and provide empirical evidence to critically assess them. In the subsection &ldquo;Pull Factor?&rdquo;, we analyse the variegated migration dynamics according to different countries of origin, demonstrating that despite the overall decrease of crossings towards Italy recorded over 2015, arrivals from several African nationalities were increasing, and the trends over 2016 only continued those already underway over 2015. Deep political and economic trends allow to account for the increasing crossings, not the presence of SAR NGOs. In the sub-section &ldquo;Worsening Smugglers&rsquo; Tactics ?&rdquo;, we focus on the evolution of the EUNAVFOR MED operation and its effects on smugglers&rsquo; tactics as well as shifts that took place on Libyan territory &ndash; particularly the growing involvement of militias in smuggling activities and the increasing intervention of the Libyan Coast Guard. We demonstrate that these actors and processes, whose effects started to be felt while SAR NGOs&rsquo; presence at sea was still marginal, played a key role leading to more dangerous smugglers&rsquo; tactics. SAR NGOs responded to these shifts and were not their driving cause. Finally in the sub-section &ldquo;Increasing the Danger of Crossings?&rdquo;, we analyse the response of NGOs to these worsening conditions of crossing, demonstrating that the deployment of SAR NGOs did contribute to make the crossing safer but also led to consolidate some of the shifts in the practices of smugglers. By untangling the threads of the multiple processes and actors that have shaped the dynamics of maritime crossings we demonstrate the accusations formulated against SAR NGOs rest on biased analysis and spurious causality links.</p>

                    <p>Finally, in the &ldquo;Conclusions&rdquo; section, we summarily rebut the claims against SAR NGOs. While they are based on deeply flawed analysis, we show the toxic narrative they have fuelled has nonetheless served to reinforce a number of strategic effects with regards to EU migration policies. It has allowed state actors mobilising these arguments to divert public attention from their own responsibilities and failures; the de-legitimisation and criminalisation of proactive SAR is in continuity with prior policies &ndash; such as the ending of Mare Nostrum &ndash; which have targeted SAR activities to make the crossing more difficult in the aim of deterring migrants; finally this toxic narrative has also served to legitimise policies of cooperation with dictatorial regimes at the EU&rsquo;s periphery to stem crossings. While SAR NGOs cannot in and of themselves be a sufficient response to the deaths of migrants at sea as long as insufficient legal pathways for migration exist, the fate of migrants would be even worse without them. We illustrate the life-saving role they continue to have through the central role they played in the rescue of more than 9,000 migrants over the Easter weekend this year. We argue that in the face of the horrendous death toll that is the product of the EU policies of closure, the right to solidarity at sea must be asserted.</p>
