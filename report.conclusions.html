                        <em>(1) NGOs operating close to Libyan territorial waters constitute a &ldquo;pull-factor&rdquo; leading to more migrants attempting the dangerous crossing</em>

                    <p>
                        Our report has demonstrated that the increased crossings recorded in 2016 were not the product of the supposed &ldquo;pull-factor&rdquo; constituted by SAR NGOs, but were a continuation of a trend that had already begun independently of the presence of SAR NGOs. This rise in crossings (especially of migrants from Central and Western Africa) was the product of worsening economic and political crises that affected several countries and regions across the African continent, including the chaos raging in Libya. These trends were reported by Frontex both internally and externally, but were not mentioned in relation to the agency&rsquo;s arguments against SAR NGOs. As the continued crossings in the wake of the termination of Mare Nostrum demonstrated, while the prospect of being saved may give hope to migrants that they will survive the perilous crossing, those stuck in Libya have little choice but to attempt it, and do so with or without dedicated SAR operations. A very similar rebuttal of the &ldquo;pull-factor&rdquo; argument has been made by institutional figures with no interest in defending the NGOs such as the commander in chief of the EUNAVFOR MED Mission, Admiral Credendino,

                        Finally, while the empirical analysis shows that the &ldquo;pull-factor&rdquo; argument is flawed, it should also be highlighted that, regardless of its veracity, it rests on the morally questionable assumption that it would be wrong to provide migrants with a safe(r) opportunity to leave the extremely dire situation in Libya and cross the Mediterranean. Whoever invokes this argument is also implicitly legitimising the use of the prospect of death at sea as a deterrent.

                        <em>(2) NGOs are unintentionally helping criminals by encouraging smugglers to use even poorer quality boats and more dangerous tactics</em>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our analysis shows that SAR NGOs <em>responded</em> to evolving smuggling practices that had been spurred by endogenous dynamics in Libya and heightened by the EU&rsquo;s anti-smuggling operation, EUNAVFOR MED. At the heart of the continuous degradation of the conditions of crossing since 2013, has been the violent and chaotic situation in Libya, which at the end of 2015 led to a new and more dangerous model of militia-led smuggling. The EU&rsquo;s anti-smuggling operation, EUNAVFOR MED had an important impact on smugglers&rsquo; tactics, as recorded in its own internal reports.
                            {% include footnote-block.html content='European External Action Service (EEAS), <em>EUNAVFOR MED Op SOPHIA - Six Monthly Report 22 June - 31 December 2015</em>, 28 January 2016.

                        By interdicting and destroying the vessels used by smugglers, it confined them to Libyan territorial waters and contributed to the shift from wooden to cheap rubber boats. That such tactical shifts were noted at the end of 2015 and in the first months of 2016, when the presence of SAR NGOs was limited, further confirms that SAR NGOs were not causing them. Finally, under pressure from the EU, the Libyan Coast Guard (LGC) has increasingly intervened to intercept migrants&rsquo; boats as they left the Libyan coast over 2016. As the LCG repeatedly exercised violence in the process at times leading boats to capsize, it contributed to increasing the danger of crossing. In response to these trends, as of Spring 2016 NGO vessels were increasingly <em>directed</em> by the Italian Coast Guard to intervene closer to the Libyan coastline to avert situations of imminent distress. While by moving closer to the Libyan coastline, SAR NGOs may have contributed to further <em>consolidating</em> smugglers&rsquo; new practices &ndash; such as no longer providing migrants with a satellite phone, this was the condition to rescue migrants more effectively.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <em>(3) NGOs are making the crossing more dangerous for migrants despite their intentions</em>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our analysis contradicts this claim and reveals the crucial life-saving role of NGOs. While it has often been noted that 2016, the year that saw the highest number of SAR NGOs at sea, also saw a new record number of deaths (4,576) as well as a rising mortality rate in comparison to the previous year (from 1.83 to 2.46), closer analysis throughout the year tells in fact a very different story. The migrant mortality rate had risen in early 2016 before NGO SAR assets returned to the central Mediterranean following their winter break, it declined in parallel to their redeployment, and rose again only when SAR NGOs&rsquo; presence decreased at the end of Autumn. There is thus a striking negative correlation between the decreasing mortality rate and the rising number of SAR NGO vessels, which however, unsurprisingly, has not been noted by those seeking to delegitimize SAR NGOs. The life saving role of SAR NGOs has been again illustrated in 2017 through their fundamental contribution to the many SAR events that occurred over the Easter weekend, which we analyse in more detail below.

The increasing deployment of SAR NGOs succeeded in making the crossing less dangerous.' %}

                    <p>
                        Our analysis thus shows the flawed nature of these attacks. It also demonstrates that they are based on the omission of information that, although widely available, has not been mentioned by those attacking NGOs, thus fuelling what we have defined a toxic narrative. This narrative has had very real effects in public debates in terms of delegitimizing and criminalising SAR NGOs, but also, as exemplified by the recommendations of the Italian Senate&rsquo;s Commission for a stricter regulation of SAR NGO activities, initiating an institutional process that threatens their operations.
                            {% include footnote-block.html content='We refer to this in some more detail in the &ldquo;Toxic Narrative&rdquo; section.' %} 
                        Further more, the targeting of SAR NGOs has also strengthened policy directions supported by Frontex and EU member states. We can now see with more clarity these de facto effects:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong><em>Hiding the EU&rsquo;s failures </em></strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The attack on SAR NGOs has served to keep out of the spotlight and justify the failure of the &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; that EU actors had proposed in the wake of the April 2015 shipwrecks. These measures, that were meant to reduce crossings and the deaths of migrants at sea, were the expansion of Frontex&rsquo; Triton operation, and the launching of the EU&rsquo;s EUNAVFOR MED operation, which have focused respectively on border control and anti-smuggling activities. Neither of these measures have succeeded in their stated aims. Crossings have increased despite them and, as we have demonstrated, by systematically destroying the boats used by migrants, EUNAVFOR MED has even directly contributed to make the conditions of crossing offered by smugglers more dangerous. By blaming SAR NGOs for their supposed &ldquo;pull-factor&rdquo; effect and for the worsening conditions of crossing, NGOs have served as an easy scapegoat, which states could blame for the failure of their own policies.

                        <strong><em>Re-enforcing deterrence</em></strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By focusing on the &ldquo;mysterious&rdquo; presence of SAR NGOs, EU actors have also managed to mask the continuing SAR gap left by state actors in the wake of the termination of Mare Nostrum. As we have demonstrated in <em>Death by Rescue</em>, the EU and its member states pulled back from rescue at sea to enforce their policy of migration deterrence, and this retreat proved lethal.
                                {% include footnote-block.html content='Charles Heller and Lorenzo Pezzani, &ldquo;Death by Rescue: The Lethal Effects of the EU&#8217;s Policies of Non-Assistance&rdquo;, 18 April 2016, deathbyrescue.org (last accessed 12 April 2016).' %} 
                        The current attack on what has become the primary actor operating SAR &ndash; NGOs &ndash; once again threatens proactive SAR. The precedent of Mare Nostrum and the recurrent claim that SAR NGOs constitute a &ldquo;pull-factor&rdquo;, indicates that this latest attack on proactive SAR can be understood as an attempt to re-impose deterrence.
                                {% include footnote-block.html content='That Frontex would be persisting in the logic of migration deterrence has also been confirmed by investigative journalist Zack Campbell. A senior European border official with close knowledge of Frontex operations and decision-making in the upper ranks of the European Union confirmed to Campbell that he still believed the spatial retreat to impose deterrence was the correct policy. &ldquo;In order to not create a pull factor, we are patrolling up to the SAR&nbsp;area of Malta. We don&rsquo;t cover Libya&rdquo;, he is reported to have said, arguing that if the journey seems longer and more dangerous, refugees won&rsquo;t &ldquo;put their lives at risk, especially in winter, to travel all this distance to the south of Malta.&rdquo; Zach Campbell, &ldquo;Abandoned at Sea&rdquo;, <em>The Intercept</em>, 1 April 2017, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/04/01/europe-keeps-its-rescue-ships-far-from-the-coast-of-libya-where-thousands-of-refugees-have-drowned/">https://theintercept.com/2017/04/01/europe-keeps-its-rescue-ships-far-from-the-coast-of-libya-where-thousands-of-refugees-have-drowned/</a> (last accessed 12 May 2017).' %} 
                        If NGOs were forced to stop or reduce their operations, there is no doubt that many more lives will be lost to the sea. Furthermore, the opening of inquiries against SAR NGOs and their possible incrimination for &ldquo;facilitating illegal immigration&rdquo; risks bringing us back to a period prior to Mare Nostrum when civilian actors involved in the rescue of migrants at sea were repeatedly criminalized. This had the extremely dangerous effect of making seafarers reluctant to rescue people in distress, leading to repeated cases of non-assistance that caused tremendous loss of life.
                                {% include footnote-block.html content='See our &ldquo;Report on the Left-to-die Boat case&rdquo; for a concrete example of the negative repercussions of the criminalization of rescue: <a href="http://www.forensic-architecture.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FO-report.pdf">http://www.forensic-architecture.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FO-report.pdf</a>' %}
                        While the effects of the campaign of de-legitimisation and criminalisation of SAR NGOs are still unfolding, the risk of dramatically increased loss of life looms large.

                        The de-legitimisation of NGO SAR activities has also allowed other &ldquo;real&rdquo; solutions to appear as ineluctable, such as the externalisation of border control to African states, which has received an increased boost in recent months. Asked &ldquo;how can we then find a solution in the near future for the Central Mediterranean route ?&rdquo;, Frontex Director Fabrice Leggeri in his interview with <em>Die Welt</em> used the example of the closing of the Atlantic route to Spain, which was achieved through &ldquo;cooperation with African states from which migrants&rsquo; boats were leaving&rdquo;, and to which &ldquo;migrants were swiftly brought back&rdquo;.

                        This is the model Frontex has been referring to time and again, as in its 2016 Annual Risk Analysis report and it was also invoked in the European Commission&rsquo;s strategic note &ldquo;Irregular Migration via the Central Mediterranean&rdquo; of February 2017.

The European Commission notes that &ldquo;the drawbacks of SAR operations as they are currently carried out by European naval forces, coast guards and NGOs must be acknowledged with a view to stemming the numbers of irregular crossings. A purely humanitarian approach will not suffice to resolve the situation in the longer term.&rdquo; As a result, its suggest agreements and cooperation with Libya and disembarkation of rescued migrants in third countries.

                        What these proposals however omit is that the closure of the Atlantic route did not stop the crossings of illegalised migrants and deaths at sea overall, but rather displaced these crossings and deaths to other routes.

                        Furthermore, what they also neglect is the tremendous human cost of the cooperation being advocated for. Externalising migration control to &ldquo;transit and origin states&rdquo; in the central Mediterranean effectively means cooperating with (war) criminals, such as in Sudan and Eritrea, and relegating migrants to a country, Libya, where widespread human rights violations against migrants have been systematically documented.

                        In particular, the EU is increasingly relying on cooperation with the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG), the intervention of which has led to repeated loss life. In effect, targeting SAR NGOs so as to gain control over them and enabling the LCG to pull-back migrants to Libya are both sides of the same coin.

                        Considering the condition of migrants in Libya today, preventing migrants from departing from Libyan territory amounts to complicity with arbitrary detention, torture, sexual violence, forced labour and trafficking.

                        The attacks against SAR NGOs should be understood in relation to this wider attempt of criminalisation, which does not only puts migrants&rsquo; lives and rights at risk, but also the rights of EU citizens to stand in solidarity as well as their capacity to exercise civilian oversight at the EU&rsquo;s frontiers. Recognising that migrants are forced to resort to perilous means of accessing the territory of the EU as a result of the EU&rsquo;s migration policies, the right to solidarity must be asserted.

                        The analysis we have provided does not leave NGOs and their SAR activities untouched and raises important questions for their continuation. Despite their best intentions, NGOs have increasingly come to be &ldquo;sandwiched&rdquo; between the operational logics of states and smugglers alike, and instrumentalised from both sides. Furthermore, while the NGO flotilla is not the main cause of the rise in deaths and mortality and it was instead able to reduce the mortality rate in the period of its maximum deployment, the NGO flotilla was not able to prevent the increase in the overall number of deaths either. The risk that their presence would keep reinforcing the trends we have discussed, thus resulting in effects that are the exact opposite of their humanitarian aims, is real and should not be underestimated. SAR NGOs are acutely aware of this difficult position. As the authors of an internal MSF position document &ldquo;Unsafe passage&rdquo; noted: &ldquo;We are caught in a vicious circle because both smugglers and border guards are exploiting our presence at sea and people continue to die, despite our actions&rdquo;. As such, the urgent question for SAR NGOs and civil society at large is <strong>&ldquo;<em>How will SAR NGOs manoeuvre themselves out of these unwilling complicities and break the cycle of death?&rdquo;</em></strong> Most SAR NGOs have been aware from the beginning that their operations could not be, in and of themselves, a solution to end the dangerous crossings that are the product of the EU&rsquo;s policies of exclusion. They know that as long as insufficient legal pathways for migration exist, migrants will be forced to cross the sea through precarious means, the Libyan smuggling business will continue to thrive, and deaths will continue to occur, with or without their presence. As such, several SAR NGOs have consciously used their position to demand a fundamental shift towards policies enabling the passage of migrants through safe and legal means that would make their own activities redundant.

                        However, as the ending of Mare Nostrum has demonstrated, the fate of migrants would be even worse without the courageous humanitarian work NGOs have undertaken while states have remained focused on border control and anti-smuggling activities. NGO&rsquo;s SAR work thus remains both necessary and by definition insufficient. The question for them remains how to realise safe(r) passage in this challenging context.

                        The beginning of 2017 shows no sign of migrants&rsquo; crossings abating, or of the danger of crossing diminishing. Despite having been under constant attacks for several months, SAR NGOs have continued to play a central role in SAR efforts in the central Mediterranean, as exemplified by the events of the Easter weekend. Two years after the April 2015 shipwrecks that cost the lives of 1,200 people, April 2017 has once again seen record crossings. Between 14 and 16 April 2017, 9,262 people travelling on 55 different boats were rescued, constituting one of the largest events of concentrated SAR operations in the Mediterranean Sea in the past few years.
                                {% include footnote-block.html content='In a press release, the International Organization for Migration mentions 8,360 rescued migrants between 14 and 16 April 2017.

                        These SAR events have highlighted the continuing absence of state-led SAR assets. &ldquo;According to MRCC data&rdquo;, <em>The</em> <em>Guardian</em> reported, &ldquo;of the 25 ships involved in rescue operations over the Easter weekend one was operated by Frontex and one by EUNAVFOR MED. Ten belonged to NGOs, six to the Italian coastguard, six were merchant vessels, and one was an Italian navy ship.&rdquo;

                        While Frontex has subsequently clarified to us that some of the Italian Coast Guard assets mentioned by the Guardian article were co-financed by them and thus technically are part of its Triton operation, it also admitted that only 6 vessels of its 16 assets were deployed in an area close to where the SAR events were taking place and could thus participate in some capacity to the rescue efforts.

                        EUNAVFOR MED also confirmed to us that only one of its ships took part in the operations, as the operation&rsquo;s 4 other ships were either in port or busy with other tasks.
                                {% include footnote-block.html content='The German <em>FGS Rhein</em> was the only EUNAVFOR MED ship that took part in the SAR operations by rescuing 458 migrants and transferring a total of 1,186 migrants to Italy. In his hearing at the Defence Commission of the Italian Senate, admiral Credentino, Commander of the EUNAVFOR MED mission, has explained that the mission&rsquo;s assets are deliberately kept far away from the operational area where SAR events usually occur so as not to become involved in them.

                        It is in this context that NGOs have once again played a leading role in the SAR operations. As the Watch The Med-Alarm Phone network &ndash; which was in direct contact with two boats in distress and several of the NGOs operating in the area &ndash; summarized, &ldquo;the NGOs ships present in the area worked at the limit of their capabilities. [&hellip;] The crew of the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) alone rescued more than 1,500 people from 9 precarious boats, and took hundreds on board of their vessel <em>Phoenix</em>. The rescue vessel <em>Iuventa</em> of the NGO Jugend Rettet similarly took hundreds of people on board. Unable to navigate, they were even forced to send off a MAYDAY call on Sunday. Fortunately, they could successfully complete their SAR operation and safely return to Malta.&rdquo;

                        In addition to SAR NGO vessels, the newly launched NGO SAR plane <em>Moonbird</em> was also crucial in determining the position of several migrants&rsquo; boats in distress, that might otherwise have drifted unnoticed towards a tragic fate. The <em>Moonbird</em>&rsquo;s presence is a fundamental response to the decreasing provision of satellite phones recorded over 2016, demonstrating civil society&rsquo;s extraordinary capacity to respond to evolving practices at sea in the aim of enabling safer passage.

                    {% include bold-block.html content='The events of the Easter weekend highlight the continuing absence of an adequate number of state-led SAR assets, and the crucial role of SAR NGOs in filling this gap. While the number of people crossing over Easter 2017 was comparable to that recorded in April 2015, thanks to the remarkable work of all these SAR actors, &ldquo;only&rdquo; 115 casualties were recorded during the 2017 Easter weekend, instead of the 1,200 recorded in the 12 and 18 April 2015 shipwrecks. Without SAR NGOs interventions, the death toll would have been much higher. Underlining SAR NGOs&rsquo; life-saving role is the strongest antidote to the toxic narrative that has been spread against them. It does however make the prospect of them having to suspend or reduce their activities all the more worrying. The work of SAR NGOs must be able to continue without being blackmailed and criminalised. In the face of the horrendous death toll that is the product of the EU&rsquo;s policies of closure, the right to solidarity must be asserted.' %}
